##THE COMMAND INTEPRETER

Starting and Using an Interpreter (Python as an Example):

Install the Interpreter:

If you don't have the interpreter installed on your system, you need to download and install it. For Python, you can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

After installation, you should be able to access the Python interpreter from your command line or terminal.

Start the Interpreter:

Windows: Open the Command Prompt or PowerShell and type python or python3 and press Enter.

Linux/macOS: Open the Terminal and type python or python3 and press Enter.

You should see the Python interpreter prompt, which looks like >>>.

Using the Interpreter:

You can now interact with the interpreter directly by typing Python code. For example:

python

Hello, World!
You can perform calculations, define variables, create functions, and much more.
